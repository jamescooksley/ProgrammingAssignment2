##Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the
##inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix 
##inversion that we will not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that 
##cache the inverse of a matrix.

##Write the following functions:

#1)makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y){
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  settheInverse <- function(solveMatrix) inv <<- solveMatrix
  gettheInverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get, settheInverse = settheInverse, gettheInverse = gettheInverse)
}

#2)cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
#makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not 
#changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache. Computing the 
#inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. For example, if X is 
#a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  inv <- x$gettheInverse()
  if(!is.null(inv)){
    message("GETTING THE CACHED DATA")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data)
  x$settheInverse(inv)
  inv      
}
